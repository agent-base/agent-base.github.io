Beta Software is not generally available and may contain errors, defects, and inaccuracies. We provide Beta Software "as is" without any warranties and may terminate Beta Software at any time without ensuring the preservation of Beta Software data.

        <h2 className={s.h2}>Usage of Agent-Base Services</h2>
        <p className={cn(s.text, s['text-margin'])}>You may use the Agent-Base development platform to create software applications for your target user group to achieve your commercial objectives. You understand and acknowledge that the language and information generated by software applications created based on Agent-Base are derived from user-written prompts and their Large Language Model (LLM) providers (such as OpenAI). LLM is an immature technology, and any negative consequences arising from the language and information generated are not related to Agent-Base, especially if you commercialize the application but fail to meet your operational expectations (including but not limited to not meeting your advertising description expectations, target effect description expectations, etc.) or experience service interruptions.</p>
        <p className={s.text}>The development of prompts for LLM models is the core product capability and service provided by Agent-Base. During your use of Agent-Base for prompt engineering, embedding, fine-tuning, and testing of LLM models, additional resource consumption may occur. By registering or starting to use Agent-Base, you agree to the potential consumption of resources and costs associated with the LLM algorithms of this product. You should closely monitor billing changes from third-party LLM providers. You shall bear all consequences of any abnormal consumption and billing issues that prevent you from using Agent-Base services normally.</p>
